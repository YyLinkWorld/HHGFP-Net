## Installation

HSGFPNet depends on [mmrotate](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate),[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) and [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
Below are quick steps for installation.
Please refer to [Install Guide](https://mmrotate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for more detailed instruction.

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 pytorch==1.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 torchvision -c pytorch -y
conda activate open-mmlab
pip install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
mim install mmdet
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate.git
cd mmrotate
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
pip install -v -e .
```

## Get Started

Please see [get_started.md](docs/en/get_started.md) for the basic usage of MMRotate.
We provide [colab tutorial](demo/MMRotate_Tutorial.ipynb), and other tutorials for:

- [learn the basics](docs/en/intro.md)
- [learn the config](docs/en/tutorials/customize_config.md)
- [customize dataset](docs/en/tutorials/customize_dataset.md)
- [customize model](docs/en/tutorials/customize_models.md)
- [useful tools](docs/en/tutorials/useful_tools.md)

## Model Zoo

The code that has been published so far has been reorganized according to the naming convention of the modules in the paper, and all the weights used in the experiments will be released after we reorganize the experiments.
